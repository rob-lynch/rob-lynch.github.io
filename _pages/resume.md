# Work Experience

## Salesforce - October 2016 to Present

### Software Engineering Manager - October 2020 to Present

Manager of the Commerce Cloud Delivery Engineering Team

Distributed across the US, the team provides the services required to reliably release and orchestrate minimally disruptive deployments of software artifacts into Commerce Cloud's (CC) first party and public cloud environments.

The team works to promote a culture of innovation, quality and service ownership, while ensuring the last mile of the SDLC is efficient, thorough, and complete, guaranteeing the best outcomes for engineering teams and customers.

Core Managerial Values and Mantras:

* Providing a high level of autonomy and a psychologically safe environment to allow for calculated risk taking and room for failure.
* Maintaining a honest, trusting channel of communication with direct reports - ensuring everyone has a voice by providing an equitable platform that empowers individuals to speak their mind through weekly team meetings and one on ones.
* Driving a healthy habit of RCCAs and Post Mortem discussions when issues arise, focusing on lessons learned and areas of improvement.
* Stressing the importance of continual self-improvement through personal development.
* Encouraging time for passion projects such as Hackathons and filing patentable work.
* "Less talking and more doing" - protecting individual contributors from excessive meetings, so they can focus on producing high quality work.
* "Family first" - allowing reports to maintain a healthy work/life balance, by prioritizing their personal and familial wellbeing.
* "The proof is in the data" - quantifiable problems promote change. Instilling the value of metrics to strengthen an argument or validate a requirement.
* "Knowledge is Power" - fostering the importance of regularly holding team demos, tech talks and knowledge transfers to ensure outward growth as a team.
* "ABD: Always be Documenting" - not only critical to amassing knowledge that can easily be disseminated, but for encouraging healthy asynchronous collaboration.
* “Success through trust” - delivering projects as promised and on time, while taking accountability when things don't go as planned.

Responsibilities:

* Supporting all areas of career development and HR related tasks.
* Running Agile ceremonies as the team's scrum master.
* Collaborating with the team's Product Owner for Release Planning - crafting obtainable milestones/deliverables, defining team dependencies and engaging stakeholders to ensure aligned objectives.
* Drafting executive summaries and forward looking organizational proposals through non biased, evidence backed reviews.
* Providing a first line of defense for support investigations - triaging requests, collecting logs and engaging stakeholders for additional information.
* Performing quarterly reviews to ensure PCI/SOX/SOC compliance.

Key Contributions:

* Defined an escalation and support model via an L4/L5 on-call PagerDuty rotation.
* Implemented a living "Team Working Agreement" to encapsulate what's needed for success as a distributed team.
* Enforced Security Assessment and Change Management requirements for all eligible engineering work.
* Ensured no slippage in the customer communicated release calendar of ECOM (The CC monolith).
